# DMComm

Drafts for Arduino library to communicate with Digimon toys, by BladeSabre ( bladethecoder@gmail.com ). License: MIT.

For the working version which is not a library, see https://github.com/dmcomm/dmcomm-project .

For the CircuitPython version for RP2040, see https://github.com/dmcomm/dmcomm-python .

This was not really a good design, and would be better redone in a similar way to `dmcomm-python`.
